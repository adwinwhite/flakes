# Provide a command to execute when copying text. The text will be piped to
# the stdin of the program to perform the copy. This can be used with
# terminal emulators which do not support the OSC 52 ANSI control sequence
# that will be used by default if this option is not set.
# Examples:
#copy_command: "xclip -selection clipboard" # x11
copy_command: "wl-copy"                    # wayland
#copy_command: "pbcopy"                     # osx

# Choose the destination for copied text
# Allows using the primary selection buffer (on x11/wayland) instead of the system clipboard.
# Does not apply when using copy_command.
# Options:
#   - system (default)
#   - primary
# copy_clipboard: primary
